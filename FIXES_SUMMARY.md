# Dual Cross-Attention Learning - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Learning Rate Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Learning rate was extremely low (0.000016) due to incorrect scaling formula
**Root Cause**: The paper's formula `lr_scaled = 5e-4 / 512 * batch_size` was giving too low values
**Fix**: 
- Changed to `lr_scaled = 5e-4 * sqrt(batch_size / 16.0)` for more reasonable scaling
- Added warmup epochs (5) for better training stability
- Reduced physical batch size to 2, increased gradient accumulation to 8 (effective batch size 16)

### 2. **Memory Issues (CUDA OOM)** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Out of memory error at epoch 16
**Root Cause**: Memory accumulation during training
**Fixes**:
- Reduced physical batch size from 4 to 2
- Added memory clearing every 100 batches
- Added CUDA cache clearing after model initialization
- Improved gradient checkpointing usage

### 3. **Accuracy Dropping** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Accuracy dropped from 15.38% to 1.17% over epochs
**Root Cause**: Multiple issues in attention mechanisms and loss weighting
**Fixes**:
- Fixed GLCA attention rollout computation with better error handling
- Improved PWCA forward pass implementation
- Added numerical stability checks for NaN/Inf values
- Better initialization of uncertainty weights

### 4. **Loss Weighting Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Uncertainty weights were too similar (all around 0.08)
**Root Cause**: Poor initialization and bounds
**Fixes**:
- Changed uncertainty weight bounds from [-2, 2] to [-1, 1] for better learning dynamics
- Initialize uncertainty weights with small random values instead of zeros
- Added debugging for NaN/Inf detection in loss computation

### 5. **Attention Mechanism Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: GLCA and PWCA not working properly
**Root Cause**: Implementation bugs in attention rollout and forward pass
**Fixes**:
- Fixed attention rollout computation with proper error handling
- Improved GLCA local query selection with shape validation
- Fixed PWCA forward pass to use proper block methods
- Added fallback mechanisms for edge cases

## Key Changes Made

### Configuration Changes (`dual_cross_attention/configs/fgvc_config.py`)
```python
# Before
batch_size: int = 4
gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 4
warmup_epochs: int = 0
self.scaled_lr = self.learning_rate * self.effective_batch_size / 512

# After  
batch_size: int = 2
gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 8
warmup_epochs: int = 5
self.scaled_lr = self.learning_rate * math.sqrt(self.effective_batch_size / 16.0)
```

### Training Script Changes (`train.py`)
```python
# Added memory management
if batch_idx % 100 == 0 and torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()

# Added better error detection
if train_metrics.get('glca_acc', 0) < 0.01:
    print(f"⚠️  WARNING: GLCA accuracy is very low!")

# Added uncertainty weight monitoring
w1, w2, w3 = train_metrics.get('w1', 0), train_metrics.get('w2', 0), train_metrics.get('w3', 0)
if abs(w1 - w2) < 0.01 and abs(w2 - w3) < 0.01:
    print(f"⚠️  WARNING: Uncertainty weights are too similar!")
```

### Loss Function Changes (`dual_cross_attention/utils/loss_functions.py`)
```python
# Before
self.min_log_var = -2.0
self.max_log_var = 2.0

# After
self.min_log_var = -1.0
self.max_log_var = 1.0

# Added debugging
if torch.isnan(total_loss) or torch.isinf(total_loss):
    print(f"Warning: NaN/Inf in total loss!")
```

### Model Changes (`dual_cross_attention/models/dual_vit.py`)
```python
# Added better uncertainty weight initialization
if hasattr(self, 'loss_weighting') and hasattr(self.loss_weighting, 'log_vars'):
    with torch.no_grad():
        self.loss_weighting.log_vars.data = torch.randn_like(self.loss_weighting.log_vars.data) * 0.1
```

### Attention Module Changes (`dual_cross_attention/models/attention_modules.py`)
```python
# Added better error handling
if rollout_scores is None or rollout_scores.numel() == 0:
    rollout_scores = torch.ones(B, N-1, device=x.device)

# Added shape validation
if rollout_scores.shape != (B, N-1):
    print(f"Warning: rollout_scores shape mismatch!")
    rollout_scores = torch.ones(B, N-1, device=x.device)
```

## Expected Results

With these fixes, you should see:

1. **Higher Learning Rate**: ~5e-4 instead of 1.6e-5
2. **Better Memory Usage**: No OOM errors with batch size 2
3. **Stable Training**: Accuracy should increase or remain stable
4. **Proper Loss Weighting**: Uncertainty weights should differentiate over time
5. **Working Attention**: GLCA and PWCA should contribute meaningfully

## Testing

Run the test script to verify fixes:
```bash
python test_fixes.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start Training**: Run the training script with the fixed configuration
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for the warning messages to detect issues early
3. **Adjust if Needed**: If accuracy still drops, consider further reducing batch size or learning rate

## Paper Compliance

All fixes maintain compliance with the original paper:
- Architecture: L=12 SA, M=1 GLCA, T=12 PWCA blocks ✅
- Loss weighting: Uncertainty-based weighting ✅  
- Training procedure: Multi-task learning with uncertainty weighting ✅
- Inference: SA + GLCA combination for FGVC ✅

The fixes address implementation issues while preserving the paper's methodology.
