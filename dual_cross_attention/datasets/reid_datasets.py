Object Re-Identification (Re-ID) Datasets

This module implements data loaders for Re-ID benchmarks used in the paper:
1. Market1501: Person Re-ID, 1501 identities, 32,668 images  
2. DukeMTMC-ReID: Person Re-ID, 1404 identities, 36,411 images
3. MSMT17: Large-scale Person Re-ID, 4,101 identities, 126,441 images
4. VeRi-776: Vehicle Re-ID, 776 vehicles, 49,357 images

Preprocessing follows paper specifications:
- Person datasets: Resize to 256x128
- Vehicle datasets: Resize to 256x256  
- SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9, weight decay 1e-4
- Cross-entropy + triplet loss
- Batch size 64 with 4 images per ID
