Attention Rollout Implementation for Dual Cross-Attention Learning

This module implements attention rollout computation as described in the paper
and based on the reference implementation in vit_rollout.py. Attention rollout
tracks how information flows from input tokens through transformer layers by
recursively computing attention across all previous layers.

Key equation from paper:
Ŝ_i = S̄_i ⊗ S̄_{i-1} ⊗ ... ⊗ S̄_1
where S̄_l = 0.5S_l + 0.5E (accounts for residual connections)

This is used by GLCA to identify high-response local regions for cross-attention.
